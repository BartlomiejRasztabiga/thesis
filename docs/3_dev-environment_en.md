# Chapter 3: Development Environment

In this chapter, we will discuss the programming environment used for the development and deployment of the application. The programming environment can be divided into two types, local and remote.

## 3.1 Local Environment

The local environment consists of the following:

- Operating System: MacOS 13.3.1
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE): IntelliJ IDEA 2022.3.3
- Deployment Environment: Docker + Docker Compose

The IntelliJ IDEA IDE is used for writing, testing, and debugging code. Docker and Docker Compose are used to create and manage containerized environments for the application.

## 3.2 Remote Environment

The remote environment is used for deploying the application to production. The remote environment consists of the following:

- Operating System: Ubuntu 22.04
- Machine Specifications: 4vCPU, 12GB RAM, 50GB SSD
- Location: Stockholm, Sweden
- Kubernetes Cluster: MicroK8s 1.27

The remote environment is hosted on a machine with higher specifications to ensure the smooth running of the application in production. The location of the machine is Stockholm, Sweden, and it runs on the MicroK8s 1.27 Kubernetes cluster. The Kubernetes cluster is used for managing the deployment of the application in a scalable and reliable manner.
